# Jelajah-Harmoni-Nusantara
A game that was made to introduce *Indonesia's traditional songs* to the younger generation and general citizens in general. Using [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) as the main framework. 

## Ver 1.0 (It works! Finally!)
Happy to finally release the project that we have been working on for 1-2 months. 

There are still some things that we need to work on: 
- Still local, not adaptable for phones.
- A & B notes sound --> too low an octave
- The jump isn't satisfying - needs more gravity (inputs from our friends!)
- Only have a choice of 3 songs (Sinanggar Tulo, Soleram, Suwe Ora Jamu)

Please wait for the next update :D
